      The <section> element should always have a heading element inside <h1>, <h2>, etc. to identify what's here.
     
     Using section elements and numbering your heading elements in order helps make your site maximally accessible to people who 
      read websites with screen readers, braille browsers, and other devices that don't rely exclusively on using your eyes.
