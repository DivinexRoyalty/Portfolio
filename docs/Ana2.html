                    <h1> – Characters and Items –</h1>
                    <p> The game invites you to play as the mother of the daughter who was 
                        sent to the boarding school. You learn who the characters by playing the 
                        intro of the game where you start out in a bathtub and recieve a phonecall
                        that your daughter is sick and needs to be picked up. We never meet the daughter
                        in the game however, we get a very close interaction with the Nun. She vigorously 
                        chases you around the school in order to murder you before you can (A) kill her or 
                        (B) rescue your daughter from the school. 
                        </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Although there are no NPC's in the game, yo uhave multiple items
                        that you are able to use in order to reach one of the multiple endings of 
                        the game. My Kumu.io graph lists certain areas and each object (with a description) 
                        in order to help you beat the game. {THIS GRAPH IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND CAN BE ACESSED IN THE DROPDOWN MENU}
