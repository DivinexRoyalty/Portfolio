                         Night of the Nun provides a very immersive world for the user to enter. From the description
                         listed on Itch.io, you (the player) are a mother who is placed in a Catholic boarding school where you must rescue your
                         daughter from a nun. The graphics for the game give a very pixelated N64 environment to it
                         with a 3D sense where you have free will to move and explore the whole school.
