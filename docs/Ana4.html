                       Overall, I would rate Night of the Nun a 5/5 star game. I love how emmersive and environmental the game is.
                       The developers did a great job at making sure the player felt like they were actually in the game and created 
                       a kaleidoscope type ending sequence for us to experience which enhances the experience. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The only critque I would add is that it would have been nice to see the daughter incorporated into the game and we see
                    the mother be reunited with her in one of the endings.</p>
